**Multilevel attribute inference mechanism on attributed social networks**
**Abstract**
In social networks, users possess hierarchical user attributes that serve as self-descriptive 
information. Attribute inference plays a crucial role in social networks for user classifications 
and targeted recommendations. However, current approaches mainly focus on the flat 
inference problem, leading to significant inconsistencies in multi-level tasks. This project 
addresses this issue by proposing a solution i.e., Multi-level Inference model, that takes into 
account the semantic hierarchy of user attributes. By considering the hierarchical structure, this 
approach aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of attribute inference, enabling more 
consistent and effective user classifications and targeted recommendations on social platforms.
Attribute inference is relevant because it enables social platforms to improve user experiences, 
provide personalized services, optimize platform operations, and drive targeted advertising, 
ultimately enhancing the value and effectiveness of social network platforms
